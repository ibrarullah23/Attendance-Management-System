# Attendance Management System

## Project Overview
This is a C++ console-based application that helps manage student attendance. The system allows students to log in, view their attendance records, and for administrators to manage student data and attendance efficiently.

## Functionalities
- **Student Login:** Students can log in with their enrollment number and view weekly attendance.
- **Admin Login:** Admins can log in to register new students, mark attendance, view attendance records, and remove student data.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Track daily attendance (Mon-Fri) for each student.
- **Data Management:** Load and save student details and attendance records from and to files.

## What I Have Learned
- Implementing basic file handling in C++ to store and retrieve data.
- Structuring programs using functions and structs to manage user data.
- Creating simple login authentication systems for users and administrators.
- Handling basic console input/output operations and building user-friendly interfaces in C++.
